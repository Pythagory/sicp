* What's up with this fork?

  Google Play Books rejects the output .epub file from this source, and running it through 
  epubcheck generates a list of errors and warnings a mile long. This is an attempt clean up
  the markup and make an epub copy of the book that is compliant with the spec.

* What is this?

  This is the seminal Structure and Interpretation of Computer
  Programs, Second Edition (SICP), converted to ePub format.

  The HTML version used low-resolution GIFs to represent complex
  layouts and non-ASCII characters. Wherever possible, I have replaced
  these with Unicode and HTML. There are still many diagrams and
  figures left, though. If you’d like to contribute, redrawing those
  in SVG would be an immense help.


* Why?

  Because I wanted to read it on my iPad, and I wasn’t happy with the
  existing digital editions.


* How do I use it?

  This is the raw source for the book. If you’d just like to read it,
  you’ll find what you’re looking for [[http://github.com/ieure/sicp/downloads][in the downloads tab]].

* What’s left to do?

** TODO Fix TOC

   iBooks doesn’t let you jump to an anchor within a page from the
   table of contents, so the chapters need to be broken down into
   smaller files to make this work.

** TODO Repleace remaining GIF figures with markup or SVG

   Many of the figures are trivial and can be replicated with plain
   markup and Unicode. Others are more complex and will require
   redrawing, preferably in SVG.

** TODO Use =<code>= instead of =<tt>=

   Many places where there are inline mentions of function and
   variable names, these are wrapped in =<tt>= for display
   purposes. The correct semantic element is =<code>=.

** TODO Fix source listings

   All the source is formatted with =<tt>= and non-breaking spaces. A
   =<pre>= would be much nicer.

** TODO Better footnotes

   The footnotes are all at the end of each chapter. It might be nice
   to move them all to the end of the book, one per page, so they’re
   not in the way when you finish a chapter.
